# Script for hosting teaching demos
## Introduction
Welcome!
My name is Gerard Capes, and I'm an instructor trainer,
and lesson maintainer for the Carpentries.

It's nice to lead these teaching demo sessions,
because I get to see some of the new instructors
and start to get to know you.

Say something about the group
e.g.
- I use Python/Git all the time,
  so it's nice to see how other people approach teaching these subjects
- I don't know much about R/OpenRefine, so I can look at that from
  a novice perspective when I see others teaching it

Round of introductions (name and institution) - practice using the mute button.

## Overview
This is a not a high-stakes test!
It's a friendly opportunity to give and receive feedback - occasionally we
ask people back for a second try, and if so your follow-up email will give
clear instructions what we'd like you to change on your next visit.
It doesn't mean we don't want you as an instructor - it means that we want
you to be ready to put your best foot forward in the classroom and we're
here to help you with that.

## Detail of the demos
So on the etherpad, each of you has signed up to teach one of our lessons
and I'll give you a specific section for you to start teaching from.
You'll have a moment to get yourself oriented, share your screen,
then you'll have 5 minutes to teach.

You'll hear my timer go off, and then we'll take a few minutes giving each other
feedback in a new etherpad, using the +/- for both content and presentation
as you did during your instructor training.

As the presenter you'll have chance to share any feedback on yourself
and comment on the experience.

It's a bit of an artificial environment, teaching for just 5 minutes, out of context.
You can assume that people are already familiar with previous parts of the lesson,
but have necessarily mastered them.

So what I'll be looking for is that you are prepared, knowledgeable about your subject,
speak well, and that you incorporate the pedagogical practices that you learned
in instructor training.

What questions do you have?

## The demos
Do the demos, get feedback from the presenter, summarise feedback from the etherpad.

## Closing
Thanks for your excellent feedback!
I'll follow up with each of you by email within a day.
